Dotfiles

  ordered stuff here, so I didn't change anything. I suggest to remove everything
  and clone this repo again.**

A *n*-times try to keep my dotfiles managed. This time with the awesome [rcm][]
to manage the dotfiles and [prezto][] as the main (zsh) framework. Please take in
mind this config assumes prezto installed, so a lot of stuff it's likely not to
work as intended if you don't have it.

### Prerequisites

+ terminal
    + Zsh 4.3.10 (prezto prerequisite)

+ window management
    + bspwm
    + sxhkd
    + lemonbar with various fonts:
        + stlarch (`stlarch_font` / `stlarch-font-ibx`)
        + tewi-font (https://github.com/lucy/tewi-font)
        + terminus (`terminus-font`)

Install
-------

1. Install [rcm][]
2. Clone the dotfiles:

        git clone https://github.com/PaBLoX-CL/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles

3. View what would be installed

        RCRC="config/rcrc" lsrc

4. Install

        RCRC="config/rcrc" rcup

5. Consider mixing and using tags

        RCRC="config/rcrc" rcup -t gui

6. Install Prezto & its submodules

        git clone https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto ~/.dotfiles/config/zsh/.zprezto && cd ~/.dotfiles/config/zsh/.zprezto && git submodule update --init --recursive

7. Update submodules

        cd ~/.dotfiles
        git submodule update --init --recursive

8. Profit! :moneybag:

What's included?
----------------

My config it's opinionated, so there are a couple of things you have to
have in mind:

+ When it's possible, configs will try to match vim style
+ Assumes [prezto][] installed
~~+ My configuration is heavily based on [Meslo (patched) Font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts/tree/master/Meslo) (ttf-meslo-powerline-git in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/)~~

### External stuff (*aka* submodules)

Right now this project makes use of the following submodules:

+ [prezto][]
+ My vim configuration (not yet available)
+ [Seebi's dircolors](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized)
+ [base16 colors](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for the shell and xresources

Rationale
---------

I decided to build my own "dotfiles" because that's the only way to really
understand what's going on below. I chose prezto because it doesn't interfere
too much with the normal functioning of the zsh shell and has sane defaults.

I tried to make this little project with all the documentation as possible,
because I found that's one of the easiest (and most fun) ways to learn. So you
are likely going to found a lot of comments and text.

[Dotfiles are meant to be forked](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/)
it's a great article to understand why I made some decisions about the structure
and organization.

I also made this as *delete friendly* as possible, so you can strip and take what
you found interesting.

Bugs
----

I have tried to make this to work everywhere, so if there's any issue please
don't hesitate to [tell me](https://github.com/PaBLoX-CL/dotfiles/issues/new).

Acknowledgments
---------------

My dotfiles have been made possible after a lot of years of customizing and
tweaking. I tried hard to document everything, but I'm sure there's a lot I
missed. Anyway, here are those who were my main inspiration:
